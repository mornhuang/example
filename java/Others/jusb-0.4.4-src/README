This jUSB package has a Java API for access to USB, and two separate
implementation.  It's licensed under the LGPL.  The website is:

	http://jusb.sourceforge.net/ 

At this writing, only Linux provides "native USB" access, and other
platforms must use RMI (experimental).


JAVA REQUIREMENTS

The runtime assumption is only JDK 1.1, so that most of the trimmed down
Java profiles (including Embedded Java and Personal Java) should work with
the "usb.core" APIs.  That includes of course some J2ME profiles; several
non-Sun implementations of Java should also be usable.

Builds have recently been done with Kaffe 1.0.6 (partial build), JDKs 1.3
and older, and the GCJ 2.96 snapshot in RedHat 7.  All of those have worked
as runtime environments.  Your mileage may vary.


HOST OPERATING SYSTEM ISSUES

See README.linux for information about building and using this on Linux.
There's a good selection of usable JVMs on Linux; not all support RMI.

At this time, USB devices must be connected to a Linux host (and using an
RMI-equipped JVM) for them to be accessed from any other operating system.
The "wire protocol" (and SPI) is expected to evolve.

For Win32 developers, compile using GNU make from "cygwin" (found at
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin). Read the makefile; you need to set
JAVA_HOME when you build.  You'll need to update your local Win32 machine's
registry to point to some Linux USB server.  That support is experimental;
read the source code to figure out how to set it up.


BUILDING

Assuming you have extracted this software into your shell's current
directory, just unpack the sources (not needed with CVS children)
and build:

    $ mkdir src
    $ cd src
    $ tar xfz ../src.tgz
    $ cd ..
    $ make
    ...
    $ make javadoc
    ...
    $

If there is platform-specific code for your system, it should get
built automatically.  (If it isn't, figure out why!)  RMI stubs
and proxies are also built (and RMI/IIOP ones on JDK 1.3).

There's also basic GCJ support in the Makefile.  At this writing
it uses GCJ only to create header files (so jUSB may be called
from compatible C/C++ programs) and compile to native code, not
to create classfiles.  Don't bother with versions older than the
GCJ 2.96 release.


SANITY CHECKING

The simplest test just gives an XML dump of what's on your bus, in
relatively gory detail.  Most of these element types are kinds of
device descriptor that you'll get to know if you work directly with
a USB API; any language identifiers relate to internationalization
support provided by the device vendors.

    $ make show
    <!-- Linux usbfs -->
    <host busses='3'>
      <!-- Bus #1 -->
      <?addresses portid='usb-fca0' busaddr='5'?>

		  <endpoint addr='1' direction='in' type='bulk'

		  <endpoint addr='2' direction='out' type='bulk'

		  <endpoint addr='3' direction='in' type='interrupt'

	      </vendor-specific>
	</hub>
      <!-- Bus #2 -->
      <?addresses portid='usb-cc847000' busaddr='2'?>

    ... etc ...

    </host>
    $

If you didn't get something like that, the diagnostics you got instead
should be telling you what went wrong and how to fix it.  Once it works
correctly, everything else should be fine.


If you have Swing available, there's a simple interactive demo:

    $ make viewer
    ... Swing browser of bus and device state
    $

That does live updates of the bus structure, and can be taught
device-specific behaviors.  It doesn't yet work for remote hosts,
unless you manually update your local registry to point there.
