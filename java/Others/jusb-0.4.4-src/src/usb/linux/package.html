<p> This package has a Linux implementation
of a <em>usb.core.Host</em> object,
bootstrapping support, and
other classes leveraging Linux USB support.
It accesses the "usbdevfs" userspace APIs
(a set of currently undocumented ioctl calls)
using a small bit of native code.
Both Free Software (GCJ/CNI) and
commercially legislated (Sun's JNI) APIs to
native code have current implementations.

<p> Multiple CPU types are supported.
Only x86 and compatible systems have gotten substantial testing.
Testing hasn't yet turned up problems when using Kaffe,
and GCJ has worked well too;
so you can freely choose your technology partners.
(You aren't forced to license some specific commercial JVM,
such as Sun's or IBM's.)

<p> The rest of this package overview is a summary of
Linux-specific issues you may need to know about.


<h3> usbdevfs permissions </h3>

<p> For the moment, either work as root or set up <code>/etc/fstab</code>
to have your <em>/proc/bus/usb</em> entry
use the <code>devmode=0666</code> option.
That option means anyone can claim use of any USB device that's not got
a kernel driver.  For a true single-user machine,
that's the model you'll expect.
There are other usbdevfs mount options that can help you set up for
other configurations; the Linux default is set up for use as root.


<h3> Bulk Messaging Throughput and Latency </h3>

<p> Bulk I/O is currently limited by "usbdevfs" to single page
(4KBytes) chunks,
so larger writes are broken up before usbdevfs sees them.
At peak throughput, that means less than four milliseconds data time
before needing to schedule your Java thread
again, just to keep the request queue full.
Sends and receives will have a minimum latency of around a millisecond;
this implementation currently does not support asynchronously
queued I/O requests.

<h3> Kernel Drivers for Interfaces </h3>

<p> At this time, interfaces with native Linux drivers
can't be accessed using <em>usb.core</em> APIs unless that
kernel driver is not loaded into the Linux kernel.
The reason for this is that kernel drivers always have
the first chance to claim bind to interfaces, and
there is no current mechanism for unbinding them.
You would normally use filesystem APIs to access such devices;
they will often appear in
<em>/dev/usb/...</em>, or as SCSI devices, or so on.
See the experimental <a href="HID.html">HID</a> driver for an
example of device access using such filesystem APIs.
(There are a lot of kinds of HID devices.  The Linux model
for accessing them involves ignoring the fact that they
happen to be connected using USB.)

<h3> Nonconformant USB Devices </h3>

<p> Some devices (often early USB 1.0 ones, or "cheap"
ones that haven't been tested effectively -- perhaps only
against some Win98 release) will not correctly expose
device descriptors after they are
configured.  At this writing, you can't work with such devices.
(A fix is now possible, since the kernel's copies of
the descriptors are now available.)

<h3><a name="control">Control Messaging Issues</a></h3>

At this writing, some of the USB host controllers won't queue
control messages.  That means that drivers can interfere with
each other:  if one driver issues a control request, it can
cause an unexpected errors in another driver.
(This ought to be improved
by the time Linux 2.4.0-final arrives.)

<p> Also, the Linux kernel has no sort of mutual exclusion
mechanism ("baton passing", etc.) to ensure that control requests are
only made at "safe" moments.
There are two risks here, which apply exclusively in cases where
multiple drivers (such as a kernel one and any user program
accessing usbdevfs) are both talking to that device:  </p><ol>

    <li> The primary risk is from lower quality USB devices,
    which aren't truly conformant to the USB specification.
    The risk is that these devices misbehave in
    the face of some standard USB requests,
    for example by locking up until after manual reset.
    <em>Just don't use such faulty devices.</em>  These likely won't
    be the only problems you would have with them. </li>

    <li>Another risk is from devices which incorporate control messaging
    into their application protocols.
    When multiple drivers are talking to such devices, message sequencing
    requirements could be violated if sequencing isn't done.
    The risk is that these devices may also misbehave.
    (At this point it is not suspected to be a substantial risk
    except for mass storage devices.) </li>

    </ol>

<p> Some common devices (such as audio devices with a HID control
for volume) can require multiple driver support.  In some cases even
single-interface devices may benefit from multiple-driver support.  For
example a standard kernel driver, plus a user mode controller to manage
device-specific features not handled by the kernel.
