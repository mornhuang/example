<h4>Main Window <br>
</h4>
<p>The Periodic Calendar main window provides calendar-centric information 
related to the menstrual periods tracking and prediction (see Figure 1).</p>
<img src="mainwindow.png" alt="Main Window screenshot" border="0">
<p><strong>Figure 1. Main Window</strong></p>
<p> The calendar pane is the core of the application. It shows the
colored monthly calendar having the menstruation first day highlighted
in red and fertile days highlighted in green (these are the default
color schema). Recorded pregnancy and children birth days are highlighted as well.
The predicted days are shown in a lighter color. The
color swatches to the right shows what does each color mean. The colors
can be changed in the <a href="#prefs">preferences dialog</a>. </p>
<p>The Selected Day Summary provides the general information for the
day which is currently selected in the calendar. It contains the
selected date, days since the cycle start, fertility and if you might
feel uncomfortable. Some women feel uncomfortable near the beginning of each
cycle. The uncomfortable days range can be selected in the <a
 href="#prefs">preferences dialog</a>. According to these settings,
Periodic Calendar shows if any uncomfortable feelings may appear on the day
selected in the calendar.</p>
<a name="per"></a>
<h4>Recording Periods</h4>
<p>The new menstruation can be recorded either using the calendar
context menu which is shown on right mouse click, or using the main
menu item <em>Calendar-&gt;Add Menstruation Record</em>. If the record
was entered by mistake, it can be removed from the calendar context
menu or using the main menu item <em>Calendar-&gt;Delete Record</em>.</p>
<p>While adding the new records to the calendar, you will notice that
the predicted fertile period is shown wider than the past fertile
periods. This happens because the fertile period starting and ending
dates depend on the cycle length. The prediction is made in "safer" way
from the contraception view point highlighting all probably fertile
days.</p>
<p>Main window status bar area shows the summary information about all
recorded periods. This includes the recorded periods count, and
minimum, average and maximum period length. Basing on the periods
length deviation from the medium value, the general calendar method
accuracy is evaluated and shown in the status bar as well.</p>
<a name="nav"></a>
<h4>Dates Navigation</h4>
<p>Calendar dates can be navigated using the tool bar month and year
navigation buttons or the <em>Navigation</em> main menu items.</p>
<p>The following shortcut keys can also be used for quick calendar navigation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Left, Right</strong> - jump to the previous or next day</li>
		<li><strong>Up, Down</strong> - jump to the previous or next week</li>
		<li><strong>PageUp, PageDown</strong> - jump to the previous or next month</li>
		<li><strong>Ctrl+M, Ctrl+Shift+M</strong> - jump to the previous or next month</li>
		<li><strong>Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Y</strong> - jump to the previous or next year</li>
		<li><strong>Ctrl+Shift+T</strong> - jump to today</li>
	</ul>

<a name="preg"></a>
<h4>Recording Pregnancy</h4>
<p>The pregnancy can be recorded using the main menu item <em>Calendar-&gt;Record
Pregnancy</em></p>
<p>The pregnancy start is calculated as the first day of the last
menstruation cycle. If there are reasonable menstruation records in the past, 
the <em>Record Pregnancy</em> dialog might appear proposing to chose either the last
menstruation date or current date as the pregnancy selection date.</p>
<p>During the pregnancy, slightly different information is presented by the application
(see Figure 2.).</p>

 border="0">
<p><strong>Figure 2. Main Window - Pregnancy Period</strong></p>
<p>If the selected day is within the recorded pregnancy period, the
Selected Day Summary is changed to show the pregnancy week number and
the predicted baby birth date.</p>
<p>To make the records complete, the baby birth date can also be
recorded (using <em>Calendar-&gt;Record Birth</em> main menu item).</p>
<p>The pregnancy period is shown from the pregnancy start date to the
birth record date or to the pregnancy interuption date which also can be recorded. If there is no birth or interruption records - the pregnancy is shown till the estimated birth date (9 month).</p>
<p>If the menstruation is recorded before the 9-month period end, the
pregnancy is shown to the first menstruation date.</p>
<a name="notes"></a>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The main window section below the calendar allows entering and
viewing the notes which can be added for any day.</p>
<p>New note for the current day can be added using the plus button near
the notes list or from the main menu.</p>
<p>If the current day already has a note, this note is automatically
shown in the notes area.</p>
<p>The note for the current day can be deleted using the minus button
or the corresponding main menu item (<em>Notes-&gt;Remove Note</em>).</p>
<a name="stats"></a>
<h4>Statistics Dialog</h4>
<p>Statistics dialog provides the general statistics for the recorded
periods as well as the periods length histogram which shows the period length
distribution (see Figure 3).</p>
<img src="statistics.png" alt="Statistics Popup screenshot" border="0">
<p><strong>Figure 3. Statistics Dialog</strong></p>
<a name="prefs"></a>
<h4>Preferences</h4>
<p>Periodic Calendar settings can be changed in the preferences window
which can be shown using the <em>File-&gt;Preferences...</em> main
menu item.</p>
<p>The <em>General</em> section of the preferences dialog allows to choose which 
file will be loaded on startup. This can be overridden by the <A HREF="#cmdline">command line
parameters</A> (see Figure 4).</p>
<img src="pref1.png" alt="Preferences 1 screenshot" border="0">
<p><strong>Figure 4. Preferences - General</strong></p>
<p><em>Calendar</em> preferences section allows changing the calendar
colors (see Figure 5.).</p>
<img src="pref2.png" alt="Preferences 2 screenshot" border="0">
<p><strong>Figure 5. Preferences - Calendar</strong></p>
<p><em>Calculations</em> preferences section allows changing the
periods prediction and other calculations parameters (see Figure 6.).</p>
<img src="pref3.png" alt="Preferences 3 screenshot" border="0">
<p><strong>Figure 6. Preferences - Calculations</strong></p>
<p><em>Add XX buffer days the start and after the end of the fertile
period</em> can be used to add the "buffer" days to the fertile period,
to be more safe about the contraception, or to make the fertile period
narrower (entering the negative values), showing the most probable
fertile days if conception is the goal.</p>
<p><em>Bad feelings start XX days before and end YY days after 
menstruation</em> line specifies the range of days which may have the
uncomfortable feelings. This does not impact any calculations - it is
used just for the user convenience.</p>
<p><em>Regular cycles are between XX and YY days long</em> option defines
which cycles should be taken into account during the next cycle length
prediction. It might happen that some cycles can last longer or shorter
than usually. If these cases are rather exceptions, their influence on
the calculations can be eliminated. Hoverer having such "unusual"
cycles makes the calendar method almost useless for the natural family
planning.</p>

<h4>Import/Export</h4>
<p>Import/Export functionality is available from the <em>File</em> main menu.</p>
<p>At this point only one format is available for the import and
export. This is the Periodic Calendar 1.x version file format which
contains only the menstruation periods starting dates.</p>
<p>Imported dates will be appended to the current data file preserving all
current records.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind, that old version of the Periodic Calendar did
not use the pregnancy records and notes. This information will not be
included in the export file.</p>
<a name="cmdline"></a>
<h4>Command Line Parameters</h4>
<p>Periodic Calendar accepts single command line parameter which is supposed to be 
a name of the file to open on startup. </p>
<p>Usage example:</p>
<pre>java -jar pcal.jar c:\docs\myfile.pcal</pre>
