      <p>
      This example uses the background-image, 
      background-position and background-attachment
      styles to place the <span class = "dark">Deitel 
      & Associates, Inc.</span> logo in the bottom, 
      right corner of the page. Notice how the logo 
      stays in the proper position when you resize the 
      browser window.
